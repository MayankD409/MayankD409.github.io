- Created a novel deep learning architecture using Graph Convolutional Networks and bidirectional-GRU to predict pedestrian trajectories in dynamic environments.
- Achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory prediction with an inference time of less than 2ms, optimizing performance for real-time applications.
- Collaborated on improving autonomous navigation in crowded spaces by integrating a Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based planner.
- Deployed the model on a Husky robot, validating simulation results through successful real-world testing.
