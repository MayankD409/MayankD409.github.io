A classic Python implementation of the Right Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (RIEKF) based on the seminal paper "A Right Invariant Extended Kalman Filter for Object-Based SLAM." This project provides a robust framework for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using object-based observations. I have tried to do detailed documentation and keep a modular code structure to facilitate easy integration in practical applications.
